# Wine Quality Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to evaluate the quality of wine using machine learning models. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the quality of a wine based on its features. The dataset used includes various attributes such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol levels.

## Objective

Our primary objective is to create a machine learning model that accurately predicts the quality of wine. We employ several machine learning algorithms including:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**

These models are trained and tested to determine their effectiveness in predicting wine quality.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical data.
   - Features are selected and transformed to ensure they are suitable for machine learning models.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Different algorithms are used to train the model, including KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
   - Hyperparameters are tuned using techniques such as Grid Search to optimize model performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are used to evaluate the models.
   - Cross-validation techniques are applied to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data.

## Current Status

The project is currently a work in progress. Key challenges faced include:

- **Overfitting**: Due to the unbalanced nature of the dataset, some models show signs of overfitting. This issue is being addressed by applying various techniques such as resampling and regularization.
- **Dataset Imbalance**: The dataset contains an imbalance in wine quality ratings, which impacts the model's ability to generalize well.

## Future Work

To improve the model's performance and address current issues, future work will focus on:

- **Handling Dataset Imbalance**: Implementing advanced techniques to address class imbalance.
- **Model Refinement**: Exploring additional algorithms and fine-tuning existing models.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhancing feature selection and transformation to improve model accuracy.
